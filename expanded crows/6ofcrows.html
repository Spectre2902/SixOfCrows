She was stolen from her parents and taken to Ketterdam against her will at fourteen. Now known as the Wraith for her ability to slip in and out of anywhere unseen and unheard, she works as a spy for the Dregs, gathering secrets and blackmail material from the most powerful players in the city. Her faith is deeply important to her, and her knives are named after her Saints. </p>

Originally from Novyi Zem, he came to Ketterdam to study at the university . . . until he discovered the city’s gambling dens and fell into serious debt. Rarely seen without his pearl-handled revolvers, he has nearly perfect aim and thrives in high-risk situations. He is always the first to crack a joke to ease the tension—or hide his true feelings.</p>

A soldier of Ravka’s Second Army, she dreams of returning home to fight for her country. But she has a score to settle in Ketterdam and will remain in the city until she makes amends for a terrible choice. Loud, flirtatious, and opinionated, Nina never hesitates to speak her mind and has a healthy appetite for the finer things in life. She’s a natural actress and her gift for languages makes her an essential addition to Kaz’s crew. </p>

He’s spent the last year imprisoned in Hellgate, trying to survive and dreaming of revenge against Nina for the betrayal that put him there. Matthias lost his family to a Grisha attack at a young age and his prejudice against Ravka’s magic wielders runs deep.</p>

                            <p>Wylan Van Eck is a runaway with a privileged past. Though no one knows what drove him to it, he fled his comfortable life among Ketterdam’s wealthiest families to take up residence in the city’s slums where he’s barely eking out an existence. Wylan would rather be playing music than building bombs, but his knowledge of chemistry makes him a valued demolitions expert. Despite his talents, he often doubts himself, and his kindness and morality make him ill-suited to life in the Barrel. </p>
